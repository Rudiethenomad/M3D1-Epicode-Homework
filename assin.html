Homework
CSS Selectors help you targeting html elements either with CSS or JavaScript.

In this exercise you’re going to have a lot of practice with them

IMPORTANT: you should NOT add any new class or ID to the file or change the HTML structure in any way, you’re allowed to only select elements with CSS Selectors & Combinators!

To test the CSS Selector you can use the color property, border, or background-color to see if the rule applies successfully. If so you’ll have successfully created a working selector!
